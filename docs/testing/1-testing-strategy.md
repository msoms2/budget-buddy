# Testing Strategy Overview

## Introduction
This document outlines the testing strategy for the Budget Buddy application. Our testing approach follows a comprehensive pyramid structure, incorporating unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure application reliability and maintainability.

## Testing Pyramid
1. **Unit Tests** (Base Layer)
   - Tests individual components and functions in isolation
   - Fast execution and high coverage
   - Focus on business logic and utility functions

2. **Integration Tests** (Middle Layer)
   - Tests interaction between components
   - Database operations
   - API endpoint functionality
   - Controller-level testing

3. **End-to-End Tests** (Top Layer)
   - Full user journey testing
   - Browser-based testing using Laravel Dusk
   - Critical path testing

## Testing Tools & Frameworks
- PHPUnit for PHP unit and feature testing
- Jest for JavaScript unit testing
- Laravel's built-in testing utilities
- React Testing Library for component testing

## Key Testing Principles
1. **Test Early, Test Often**
   - Write tests during development
   - Continuous Integration pipeline integration

2. **Code Coverage Goals**
   - Minimum 80% coverage for core business logic
   - Critical path coverage for user journeys
   - Focus on high-impact areas

3. **Test Data Management**
   - Use factories and seeders
   - Maintain test database integrity
   - Isolation between test runs

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Response time benchmarks
   - Load testing critical endpoints
   - Database query optimization checks

## Responsibilities
- Developers: Unit tests and integration tests
- QA Team: End-to-end testing and acceptance testing
- Team Lead: Test coverage review and quality gates
