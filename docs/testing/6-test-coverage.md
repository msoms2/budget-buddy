# Test Coverage Report

## Overview

This document provides insights into the current test coverage across different components of the Budget Buddy application.

## Coverage Statistics

### Backend Coverage

#### Feature Tests
| Component              | Coverage | Key Test Files |
|-----------------------|----------|----------------|
| Report Controller      | 85%      | `tests/Feature/ReportControllerTest.php` |
| Authentication        | 90%      | `tests/Feature/Auth/*Test.php` |

## Coverage Gaps

### Backend Gaps

1. **Model Testing**
   - Missing relationship tests
   - Incomplete attribute casting tests
   - Limited scope testing

2. **Service Layer**
   - Income analysis service needs more tests
   - Investment performance calculations
   - Notification service edge cases

3. **Middleware**
   - Role-based access testing incomplete
   - Custom middleware coverage low
   - Rate limiting tests missing

### Frontend Gaps

1. **Component Testing**
   - Complex UI interactions
   - State management edge cases
   - Form validation scenarios

2. **Integration Testing**
   - API client error handling
   - Loading state management
   - Offline behavior

## Improvement Plan

### Short Term Goals

1. **Model Coverage**
   ```php
   // Add tests for model relationships
   public function test_expense_belongs_to_category()
   public function test_user_has_many_transactions()
   public function test_budget_belongs_to_user()
   ```

2. **Service Layer**
   ```php
   // Add service layer tests
   public function test_income_analysis_calculation()
   public function test_investment_performance_tracking()
   public function test_notification_delivery()
   ```

3. **Component Testing**
   ```javascript
   // Add component integration tests
   describe('TransactionForm', () => {
     test('handles submission errors')
     test('validates input correctly')
     test('updates parent state')
   })
   ```

### Long Term Goals

1. **Coverage Targets**
   - Backend: Achieve 90% coverage
   - Frontend: Achieve 85% coverage
   - E2E: Cover all critical paths

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Implement automated coverage reporting
   - Set up continuous testing pipeline
   - Improve test performance

## Critical Paths

### High-Priority Flows
1. User Authentication ✅
2. Transaction Management ✅
3. Budget Operations ⚠️
4. Report Generation ✅
5. Account Settings ⚠️

### Security-Critical Areas
1. Payment Processing ✅
2. Data Export/Import ⚠️
3. User Permissions ⚠️
4. API Security ✅

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions
